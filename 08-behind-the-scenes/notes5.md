# Variable Environment: Hoisting and the TDZ

## Hoisting in JavaScript

### Execution Context Contains Three Parts

- Variable Environment
- Scope Chain
- `this` keyword

### Variable Environment

In JS we have a mechanism called hoisting.

**Hoisting** Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared. "Variables lifted to the top of their scope."

On the surface Hoisting looks like a variable being lifted to the top of the scope. But that's not really what's happening behind hte scenes.

**Before execution**, code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable, a new property is created in the **variable environment object**. That's how hoisting really works.

Hoisting does not work the same for all variable types.

                            HOISTED?                      INITIAL VALUE                    SCOPE
                               ðŸ‘‡                              ðŸ‘‡                            ðŸ‘‡

function expressions and arrows

Can use function declarations even before they are declared in the code. Because of hoisting. Block scope is only for in strict mode.

`var` variables buggy. Why we don't really use `var` in modern JS, as it's initial value is `undefined`.

`let` and `const` values: Technically they are hoisted, but their value is set to uninitialized, so as if in practice, hoisting isn't happening at all. Saying the values are placed in a Temporal Dead Zone.
