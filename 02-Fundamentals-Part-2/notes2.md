# Functions

Fundamental building block of JavaScript.

What are functions? A function is simply a piece of code we can reuse over and over again. Little bit like a variable, but for whole chunks of code.

A variable holds a value, a function can hold one or more complete lines of code.

Start wtih function keyword, and then a function name folloed by parentheses and then curly braces.
Function body is within the curly braces. Code that will be executed when we run the function.

Once a function is written, we can use it as many times as we want. We use it or "call it/invoke it/or run it" by writing the function name, followed by parentheses.

Once called, code within is executed.

Usually when we write functions, we pass data into it. A function can also return data we can use for something else in the program.

Functions are machines. Like a food processor. Put food into the food processor, does something, and then returns something, like say, juice.

Should choose a descriptive function name like variable names. And then specify parameters, parameters are specific to the function. Those parameters will be defined when function is called. Input data.

Can return that data within the function, using the return keyword. Can return any value from the function. Can be used anywhere later in our code.

The parameters are like empty spaces we still need to fill out when writing the function. When we call the function, we then fill the blank spaces by passing in real values. These values of the parameters are called arguments.

But where's the juice? (the returned string). If we want to return that sentence that was returned, need to store it in a variable, and then log it to the console. Need to capture that value in a variable, and then log it to the console, though also could have done so directly but not captured it in a variable.

thanks to the function, can reuse it with different values.

Should call a function at least once. Otherwise it's never processed.

Not all functions need to return something, and not all functions need to accept parameters.

A function without parameters or a return, really only use when there's a block of code we want to use over and over again.

Functions allow us to write more maintable code, because we can write reusable code. Part of the DRY philosophy of Don't Repeat Yourself. Functions are perfect for implementing DRY code.

`console.log()` is also a function, but a built in function we can use ourselves.

`Number()` is also a built in function.
