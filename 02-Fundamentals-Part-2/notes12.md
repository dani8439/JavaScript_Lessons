# Iteration: The For Loop

Loops are a control structure. (Just like if/else statements)

Fundamental aspect of programming, as they allow us to automate repetitive tasks.

## For Loop

for(counter; condition; )
loop statement has 3 parts, 1st part is initial value of the counter, declared with let.
2nd part is logical condition evaluated before each iteration of the loop. As soon as that condition is false, the loop stops.
3rd part is the counter, and how it updates after each iteration, otherwise would always stay at 1.
