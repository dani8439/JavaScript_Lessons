# Introduction to Objects

Another Data structure

Use curly brackets/braces `{}`

Object is filled with key/value pairs.
Key is the variable name or property
Value is the value, can be any type.

key is followed by a colon, and at the end of the pair, a comma.

Each key is called a property. Property firstName with value of Jonas, etc, etc

Many ways of creating objects. Simplest way is using the curly braces, object literal syntax, as literally writing down the entire object contents.

Use objects to group together related data. Order doesn't matter at all when we want to retrieve the data, unlike arrays where it matters a great deal. Should use arrays for ordered data, and objects for unstructered data.
