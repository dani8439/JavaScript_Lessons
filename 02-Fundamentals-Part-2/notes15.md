# While Loops

For a while loop, can only specify a condition.

`while (rep <= 10) {}`

It's called the while loop, because will only run while condition is true.

Put a counter, because need for a specific use case, but all a while loop needs is a condition.
Doesn't have to be related to any counter at all.

While loops work whenever you do not know beforehand how many iterations the loop will have.
