# Activate Strict Mode

A special mode we can activate which makes it easier for us to write secure JavaScript code.

Write 'use strict' at beginning of index to activate for all code within file. Has to be first.

Can also activate strict mode for a specific function or block.

Strict mode makes it easier to avoid accidental errors.
Strict mode forbids us to do certain things, and will create visible errors and show us in the developer console.

strict mode also introduces a short list of reserved variable names that may be introduced later.
