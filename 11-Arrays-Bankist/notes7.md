# The `.filter` method

Is used to filter for elements that satisfy a certain condition.

How do we specify such a condition? We use a callback function again.

Like `map` and `.forEach()` gets access to element, index, and array.

What's the big deal between filter and the for loop. Reason for that is the push that exists in JS for using more functional code. Also practical application in that we can chain all the methods together to build a big final result.
