# Implementing player holding the current score.

Implementing the game into smaller problems through flow chart. Makes things easier.

Functionality of holding the score, whenever user clicks on the button, it holds the score. When that happens, want to add the current score to the total score. At the moment, score resets.

Switching of the player only happens when score is below 100.
