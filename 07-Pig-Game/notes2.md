# Rolling the Dice

Want to react to clicking the roll button. Need to select that button, and add an event listener/handler

## Switching from one active player to another

When dice is not a 1, it's one player. When it is a 1, shift to logic of second block in if/else statement.
Need to keep track of which player is the current player. (or the active player when dice was rolled)
