# Boolean logic

A branch of CS that uses True & False values to solve complex logical problems.
True for all programming.

Example:
A. Sarah has a driver's license.
B. Sarah has good vision.

Boolean variabls that can be either TRUE or FALSE.

A AND B: The and `&&` operator
Sarah has a driver's license AND good vision.
Only if both A & B are true, the result will be True as well.

A OR B: The 'or' `||` operator.
Sarah has a driver's licence OR good vision
Even if one of the outcomes is false, the output will still be true. Only when both are false, is it false.

NOT A, NOT B: The 'not' `!` operator.
Inverts true/false values. Has precendence over other values, happens first

`age = 16`

A: `age >= 20` `false`
B: `age < 30` `true `

`!A` false ---> `true`
`A AND B` ----> `false & true` becomes `false`
`A OR B` ----> `false & true` becomes `true`
`!A AND B` ----> `true and true` becomes `true`
`A OR !B` -----> `false and false` becomes `false`
