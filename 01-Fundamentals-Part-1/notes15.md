# The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

Allows us to write something similar to an if/else statement, but all in one line

tests a variable, if true, after the `?` you have your if/else statement separated by a colon `:`

`whatWeAreTesting ? ifTrueDoThis : ifFalseDoThis`

The conditional is called the ternary operator, as it has three parts. The condition, the if part and then the else part.

Conditional operator is an operator, an operator always produces a value. An operator is an expression.
If we have a value, we can then assign that value to a variable. We can make the ternary operator conditionally declare variables.

Because the ternary operator is really an expression, we can use it in a template literal. And can have conditionals inside of a template literal.

Ternary operator is perfect when we need to take a quick decision. Doesn't replace the if/else statement.
