# The Switch Statement

A complicated way of writing an if/else statement

```switch(something){
    case 'something':
        console.log(something we want to do)
        break;
}
```

compares something in a strict equality way, if true, code within block is executed.
Have to have breaks, and can also set a default case.

Without the break statement, you get all the conditions and outputs as the code continues executing. Need to tell it to stop evaluating.
