# Taking Decisions: if / else statements

```
if (conditionWeAreChecking)
    if condition evaluates as true then {
    block within curly braces is executed.
    }
```

else block is optional.

```
    if (condition) {

    } else {

    }
```

if/else statement is called a control structure. Let's us have more control over the way our code is executed.

JavaScript code doesn't execute linearly. We control over what is controlled and when each block runs.

Any code declared inside of the block, is not accessible outside of the block.
