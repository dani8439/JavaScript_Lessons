# Statements and Expressions

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. Ex `3 + 4`, `1991`, `true && false && !false` They will all produce values.

A statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and does not produce a value in itself.

A declaration is like a complete sentence, and an expression are the words that make up those sentences.

We write our programs as a sequence of actions, and these actions are statements.

JS expects statements and expressions in different places.

EX: In a template literal, JS expects statements and not expression.
