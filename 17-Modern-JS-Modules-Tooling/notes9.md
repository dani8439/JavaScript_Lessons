# Bundling with Parcel and NPM scripts

Parcel - Module bundler. Fast and easy to use. Works out of the box without any configuration. Webpack is also popular, especially in React. But very complex.

It's just another built tool on npm.

dev dependecy we need to build our app, but not a depenency we ship the code with.

Parcel is installed locally. That's why it shows up in package.json. Also global installations. To use it in the console, can use `npx` or `npm scripts`

`npx parcel index.html`

Parcel starts a new development server.
