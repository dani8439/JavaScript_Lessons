# Review: Writing clean and modern JavaScript

**READABLE CODE**
ğŸ‘‰ Write code so that **others** can understand it
ğŸ‘‰ Write code so that **you** can understand it in 1 year
ğŸ‘‰ Avoid too "clever" and overcomplicated solutions
ğŸ‘‰ Use descriptive variable names: **what they contain**
ğŸ‘‰ Use descriptive function names: **what they do**

**GENERAL**
ğŸ‘‰ Use DRY principle (refactor your code)
ğŸ‘‰ Don't pollute global namespace, encapsulate data instead
ğŸ‘‰ Don't use `var`
ğŸ‘‰ Use strong type checks (`===` and `!==`)

**FUNCTIONS**
ğŸ‘‰ Generally, functions should do **only one thing**
ğŸ‘‰ Don't use more than 3 function parameters
ğŸ‘‰ Use default parameters whenever possible
ğŸ‘‰ Generally, return same data type as received
ğŸ‘‰ Use arrow functions when they make code more readable (Some people disagree on this)

**OOP**
ğŸ‘‰ Use ES6 Classes
ğŸ‘‰ Encapsulate data and **don't mutate** it from outside the class
ğŸ‘‰ Implement method chaining
ğŸ‘‰ Do **not** use arrow functions in methods (in regular objects) - because you won't have access to the `this` keyword.

**AVOID NESTED CODE**
ğŸ‘‰ Use early **return** (guard clauses)
ğŸ‘‰ User ternary (conditional) or logical operators instead of `if`
ğŸ‘‰ User multiple `if` instead of `if/else-if`
ğŸ‘‰ Avoid `for` loops, use array methods instead (`map` `filter` `reduce`)
ğŸ‘‰ Avoid callback-basked asynchronous APIs

**ASYNCHRONOUS CODE**
ğŸ‘‰ Consume promises with async/await for best readability (because `then` requires callback functions and lead to even more nested code)
ğŸ‘‰ Whenever possible, run promises in **parallel** (`Promise.all`)
ğŸ‘‰ Handle errors and promise rejections
