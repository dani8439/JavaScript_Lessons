# A Brief introduction to the Command Line

Always in a folder in the command line.

`ls` `cd` `..` `../..` `clear` `mkdir`

Up arrow opens a command again. And goes back in history. Can go back down too.

Hit tab key to autocomplete path. Just have to write first few letters.

Can add multiple files all at once. `touch jonas.js bankist.js mapty.js` creates all three at once.

To delete files can do `rm`

`mv` can move a file from current place to wherever. First need to specify the file that you want to move, and the second is the location: `mv mapty.js ../`

`rmdir` removes a directory. Only works for empty directories.

`rm -R TEST` can remove all the files in a directory and the directory itself (TEST is the name of the directory) `R` stands for recursive.
