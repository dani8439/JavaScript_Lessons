Architecture: Initial approach

User Stories

1. Log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minute (cadence).
2. Log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed, and elevation gain.

One of the most important parts is where and how to store the data. Without data it doesn't even make sense to have an app in the first place. What would it be about if not some sort of data? Data comes from the user stories.
