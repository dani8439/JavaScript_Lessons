# Sets

In the past, JS has had very little built in data structures, only had objects and arrays. But in ES6 two more were introduced, sets and maps. Pretty common data structures that exist in other languages, and now exist in JS.

A Set is basically just a collection of unique values. Can never have any duplicates. Makes them useful in certain situations
